	<u><h1>Farewell, Miss Mahwish</h1></u>
	<p>As I sit down to write this farewell note to you, I can't help but feel a sense of sadness. I have been with you for two years and it has been the best time of my life. You have been an amazing teacher and mentor to me, and I will always cherish the memories we have shared together.</p>
	<p>Back in 6th grade, I didn't even know you as a teacher. I just knew you were a person whose niece has her birthday on the 29th of February. I vividly remember you sitting at the back of 6A, during a certain class and then bombing us with that cool fact. It might seem like a small thing, but it left a lasting impression on me. And that was my first ever impression of you.</p>
	<p>It was the first week of our winter break (of 6th grade), and Frozen II came out in the theatres. And while we were waiting for our tickets then, I saw you. You were sitting across from me checking grade 9th's papers. Gosh, the irony. I didn't know whether to approach you then or not.. or even if approaching a teacher outside of school premises was even allowed lol. But then my mom forced me to meet you. And I'm so glad that she did! That was actually my first ever interaction with you. And I take pride in it haha.</p>
	<p>To be honest, first day of January, I wanted to interact with you. Ask you if you'd remembered me. But you looked so cool and intimidating.. I kinda hesitated. And then boom, the world welcomed Covid. And we shifted everything to online.</p>
	<p>Fast forward to grade eight. I met you in the online class. And we talked about Aurangzeb. And the fact you didn't have a very good internet connection, and you blamed it on your fantastic looks, which made me laugh and admire you even more. I thought you were awesome.</p>
	<p>Then, we started coming in groups, A & B. I just had to do something to make you recognize me or remember my name at least. I just had to do it somehow. And I did it :) You somehow remembered my name. It was mission accomplished. I felt so special. And when I mustered up the courage to ask you about our fateful encounter at the cinema, you actually remembered it. I was so grateful for that.</p>
	<p>Then came grade 9, and it passed in a blink of an eye. and I am going to miss everything about your class - the ground-floor classes, the exam revisions, and most importantly, the way you teach.</p>
	<p>You were the only person who could figure out that I have a hard time dealing with stress.. When you consoled me right before the house test the other day, I felt so relaxed. Those were the words that I'd been craving for.. and I actually did wellin the test. I can't thank you enough for all the support and guidance you have given me throughout these two years.</p>
	<p>As we say goodbye, I know that we all will be biased and unwelcoming towards the new history teacher. It's going to be tough accepting anyone else in your place, but I hope you know that you have left a lasting impression on all of us. You have been an inspiration to me, and I will always remember the lessons you taught me both inside and outside the classroom.</p>
	<p>Thank you for making these past two years the best time of my life. I hope you have an absolutely amazing life filled with happiness and success in everything that you do.</p>
